Take the provided resume text and return a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "polished_resume": "The fully improved version of the resume, rewritten in a professional, ATS-optimized style. 
    - Correct all grammar, spelling, and formatting errors.
    - Make the writing concise and professional.
    - Rewrite vague or incomplete points into clear, detailed, and impactful descriptions.
    - Expand the 'Projects' and 'Experience' sections with complete, detailed bullet points (technologies used, responsibilities, measurable outcomes).
    - Use action verbs (e.g., 'Developed', 'Implemented', 'Optimized') and highlight achievements with quantifiable results where possible.
    - Organize technical skills into clear categories (Front-end, Back-end, Databases, Tools, etc.).
    - Ensure formatting is consistent, clean, and modern.
    - Output the final resume in plain text (no Markdown, no comments).",
    
  "mistakes_and_suggestions": [
    "List specific mistakes, weak points, or areas to improve from the original resume, each as a separate string. Example: 'Job descriptions are too vague and lack measurable results.'"
  ],

  "skills_to_learn": [
    "List recommended technical skills, certifications, tools, or soft skills that are relevant to the userâ€™s field and will strengthen the resume."
  ]
}

Rules:
- Always output valid JSON only (no explanations, no extra text).
- Do not wrap the JSON in Markdown (json).
- Keep 'polished_resume' as the complete improved resume text.
- Ensure all keys are always present, even if arrays are empty.`;
